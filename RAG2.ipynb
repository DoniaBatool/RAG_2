For instance, when querying about materials for renovating a house, the LLM may possess general knowledge about renovation but lacks specific details about the particular house. Implementing an RAG architecture allows for quick searching and retrieval of relevant documents, such as blueprints, to offer more customized responses. This ensures that the LLM incorporates specific information to the renovation needs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of its responses.\n",
