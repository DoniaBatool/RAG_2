This approach allows LLMs to incorporate up-to-date, specific, or sensitive information that they may lack from their pre-training data alone.\n",

            "\n",
            "In traditional RAG approaches, a basic framework is employed to retrieve documents that enrich the context of an LLM prompt. For instance, when querying about materials for renovating a house, the LLM may possess general knowledge about renovation but lacks specific details about the particular house. Implementing an RAG architecture allows for quick searching and retrieval of relevant documents, such as blueprints, to offer more customized responses. This ensures that the LLM incorporates specific information to the renovation needs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of its responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "**A typical RAG implementation follows these key steps:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Divide the knowledge base:** Break the document corpus into smaller, manageable chunks.\n",
            "2. **Create embeddings:** Apply an embedding model to transform these text chunks into vector embeddings, capturing their semantic meaning.\n",
            "3. **Store in a vector database:** Save the embeddings in a vector database, enabling fast retrieval based on semantic similarity.\n",
            "4. **Handle user queries:** Convert the user's query into an embedding using the same model that was applied to the text chunks.\n",
            "5. **Retrieve relevant data:** Search the vector database for embeddings that closely match the query’s embedding based on semantic similarity.\n",
            "6. **Enhance the prompt:** Incorporate the most relevant text chunks into the LLM’s prompt to provide valuable context for generating a response.\n",
            "7. **Generate a response:** The LLM leverages the augmented prompt to deliver a response that is accurate and tailored to the user’s query.\n",
